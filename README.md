# Half datatype conversion tool for CUDA programs
### Overview
This tool will help you to convert your program from the version using *float* to *half* and *half2*.
It is written in Clang libtooling (version 4.0) because that is the only option I can find to parse CUDA code easily for now.
All contribution and pull requests are welcome.

### Requirements 
- Clang 4.0, I have not tested it on other versions of Clang but I will make it compatible to newer versions if necessary.
- G++ (g++ build is optional, you can build the tool with clang using the bash script files provided
- The tutorial on how to install Clang and setup your system can be found here [https://releases.llvm.org/4.0.1/tools/clang/LibASTMatchersTutorial.html]
- Linux & Unix OS for the bash scripts to run, otherwise you have to write your own Windows `.bat` scripts  to invoke clang plugins with appropriate flags.
### Building the binaries
- Changing the environment variables to reflect clang path in your system in the file `env_path.conf`
- Update the environment variables: `source env_path.conf` 
- There are three cpp files to be built [detect_half2_vars.cpp, half2_rewrite.cpp, half_rewrite.cpp] , you can build them using clang or g++.Using clang to build the tool is more stable but slower, while g++ can build faster but some versions may give linking/compile error. 
- Example using clang to build detect_half2_vars.cpp, (the argument for the script is a cpp file without extension): `./build_clang.sh detect_half2_vars`
- or you can do the same process using g++ (optional): `./build_g++.sh detect_half2_vars`

### Running the example
- First step is to identify the floating point variables that can be converted to half precision: 
`./detect_vars.sh test/vectorAdd.cu`
- After completing this step, you should have `half2VarsList.txt` file generated with the content is the list of function and floating point variables in them. 
- Choose your configuration from `rewrite.conf`:
  * use *half2* data type `simd_mode=true`
  * use *half* data type `simd_mode=false`
  * use operator overload header to make your code readible `operator_overload=true`
- Next step is to run the conversion tool, to convert the sample in `test/vectorAdd.cu` use: `./run_rewrite.sh test/vectorAdd.cu`
